# Beyond the Terrestrial. 
### Climate Change and the Blue Humanities

> It is fitting, however, to think of the pelagic and abyssal seas—so rarely thought—as zones that compress, transform, unmoor, or render paradoxical the scales of time and distance, the taxonomies, and other conceptual navigation systems that work on land.[^1]

BEYT is a [Cambridge AHRC-DTP](https://www.ahrcdtp.csah.cam.ac.uk/) Research Group on Blue Humanities approaches to climate and its changes. Currently, we hold monthly reading group meetings on various themes around oceans and environmental change.
