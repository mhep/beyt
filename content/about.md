# Beyond the Terrestrial. 
### Climate Change and the Blue Humanities

BEYT is a [Cambridge AHRC-DTP](https://www.ahrcdtp.csah.cam.ac.uk/) Research Group on Blue Humanities approaches to climate and its changes. Currently, we hold monthly reading group meetings on various themes around oceans and environmental change.
